## Exploratory Data Analysis

This section comes form chapter 7 of the online book [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) . The code is written by R. 

A task that statisticians call exploratory data analysis, or EDA for short. EDA is an iterative cycle. You:

1. Generate questions about your data.
2. Search for answers by visualising, transforming, and modelling your data.
3. Use what you learn to refine your questions and/or generate new questions.

EDA is an important part of any data analysis, even if the questions are handed to you on a platter, because you always need to investigate the quality of your data. Data cleaning is just one application of EDA: you ask questions about whether your data meets your expectations or not. To do data cleaning, you’ll need to deploy all the tools of EDA: visualisation, transformation, and modelling.

The exercises from the [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html)  mainly include the following parts:

### 7.3 Variation

**Variation** is the tendency of the values of a variable to change from measurement to measurement. You can see variation easily in real life; if you measure any continuous variable twice, you will get two different results. This is true even if you measure quantities that are constant, like the speed of light. Each of your measurements will include a small amount of error that varies from measurement to measurement. Categorical variables can also vary if you measure across different subjects (e.g. the eye colors of different people), or different times (e.g. the energy levels of an electron at different moments). Every variable has its own pattern of variation, which can reveal interesting information. The best way to understand that pattern is to visualise the distribution of the variable’s values.

### 7.4 Missing values

If you’ve encountered unusual values in your dataset, and simply want to move on to the rest of your analysis, you have two options.

### 7.5 Covariation

If variation describes the behavior *within* a variable, covariation describes the behavior *between* variables. **Covariation** is the tendency for the values of two or more variables to vary together in a related way. The best way to spot covariation is to visualise the relationship between two or more variables. How you do that should again depend on the type of variables involved.

#### 7.5.1 A categorical and continuous variable

#### 7.5.2 Two categorical variables

#### 7.5.3 Two continuous variables
